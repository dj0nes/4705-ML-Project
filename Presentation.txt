Term project presentation
Posted on: Wednesday, April 15, 2015 1:33:58 PM EDT
Dear Class,

Our last week (April 27th and 29th) is dedicated to project presentation. Each team should present their project and progress.  The presentation corresponds a small portion of your term project credits, 6 out of 40.  As long as you participate the presentation, you will get these 6 credits.  This presentation serves both sides: it helps you to pose questions and get some questions answered and give you a week so to correct your project; and it also helps me and the TA to get familiar with your projects, so we can better grade your hard work within a limited time frame.

Keep in mind that you don't have to finish your project when you present, you still have a couple of days before the project is due on 5th of May. But what you need to talk about in the presentation is the following:

1. what project have you decicded to work on;

2. what ML methods have you decided to try on this project;

3. what have you done to study the methods (two methods) you choose so far.

4. if you already coded a bit and already observed some results, show your results. Please also give us hints what kind of files or programming language to be expected in your final project package.

5. the team members in your group and their responsibilities.

6. if you have concerns or issues that have not been answered elsewhere, please bring them out.

If you prepare slides, it will help; or otherwise, you can write on the white board, I would not mind.

Hope you have enjoyed this class so far.  We are just going to talk about support vector machine, and then we will be all done for this semester's materials.
